# Introduction

## What is uTradeFi?

> uTradeFi is a decentralized protocol empowering investors to make money by creating synthetic trackers and smart trading rules on a peer-to-contract model without facing external exchanges

uTradeFi allows investors to make money by defining smart trading rules and let trading bots execute their customized trading strategies automatically. Smart trades can be easily setup and executed automatically by trading bots. Such actions like **profit taking** if a price trigger is reached, automatic **stop loss** if a low price is reach, are automatically run based on the defined trading rules setup by the investors. The trading is done against smart contracts at prices defined by a price oracle.

## To whom uTradeFi is addressed to?

All investors who want to make money by setting up trading strategies accross a large trading universe without the hassle to hold the underlying assets. uTradeFi allows the creation of synthetic trackers in a simple way that mimic the performance of the underlying assets. Investors benefit from the profits generated by these synthetic trackers. Investors might face losses if poor investment desicions are made where the synthetic trackers underperform the reference asset.

> uTradeFi is addressed to all investors capable of creating profits with smart investment strategies

## What asset do I need to bring to create syntetic trackers?

Syntethtic trackers are created as soon as investors bring their investment capital to the protocol. Ether is the only currency accepted by the protocol as investment capital. ETH is defined as the reference asset to calculate the profit and losses of each syntetic tracker. All mark-to-market gains and losses of the syntetic trackers are cleared in the reference asset currency.

## What is sTrack?

STrack is the symbol for the syntetic trackers created by protocol. Each tracker is unique as it's customized to the investor trading strategy. Therefore STrack is a non-tradable assets that can't be transferred or traded outside uTradeFi. Each sythetic tracker can be redeemed in their ETH equivalent value. There are no limitation for the monetization of the syntetic trackers and is allowed 24/7.  

## How do I make money?

Each investor need to bring initally some trading capital to the protocol (e.g. say 10 ETH). A syntetic tracker is then automatically minted for the specific wallet of the investor (e.g. 10 ETH). Each investor will then ammend the compostion of the synthetic tracker by deploying these ETH to other assets which will hopefully outperform ETH (e.g. convert ETH to BTC). In the case the value of the tracker expressed in ETH is above the amount of trading capital originally transfered (e.g. the tracker is worth 12 ETH), a gain was generated and the investor is in a position to capitalize that gain by redeeming the tracker to unlock it's trading capital and corresponding gain.

## Can i sell my STrack to someone else?

No, syntetic trackers are locked in the protocol. However they can be liqudidated at any time by converting the underyling assets into their ETH equivalent price and the inital investment capital freedup accordingly.

## How much does it costs?

uTradeFi pricing is failry simple:
* a flat fee of 10bp for each transaction is paid (for buy/sell, shorts and all type of advanced trade). Each time a transaction is executed that flat fee is paid.
* a performance fee is taken if the synthetic tracker generate a positive gain, ie out-permfom the reference asset when the syntetic tracker is liquiditated
