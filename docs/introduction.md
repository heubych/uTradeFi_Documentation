# Introduction

## What is uTradeFi?

uTradeFi allows investors to create **synthetic trackers** or **sTrack** across multiple asset classes. It's based on a peer-to-contract trading model where synthetic trackers are minted and burned accordingly to the investors trading activity. Investors define their trading rules by setting up **smart trading logics** that are executed automatically according to the instructions. Investors can setup various trigger points when defining their trading strategies to maximize their profits under different scenarios: e.g. **profit taking** triggers when a high price trigger is reached, **stop loss** triggers if a low price is reached, **buy backs** triggers for sell orders, etc.

> Investors create their own synthetic trackers to take advantage of their proprietary asset allocation and trading strategy.


## To whom is it addressed to?

It's addressed to all investors who want to make money by setting up winning trading strategies across a large trading universe, without the hassle to hold the underlying assets. uTradeFi allows the creation of synthetic trackers in a simple way that mimic the performance of the underlying assets. Investors benefit from the profits generated by these synthetic trackers. Investors might face losses if poor investment decisions are made where the synthetic trackers underperform the reference asset.

> uTradeFi is addressed to all investors capable of creating profits with smart investment strategies

## How do I create my sTrack?

Synthetic trackers or **sTrack** are created as soon as investors bring their investment capital to the protocol. Once the investment capital is transferred to the protocol, a unique Strack is created with a default asset allocation. The investors can then amend the synthetic tracker to reflect their own trading strategies.

Ether is the only currency accepted by the protocol as investment capital. ETH is defined as the reference asset to calculate the profit and losses of each synthetic tracker. All mark-to-market gains and losses of the synthetic trackers are cleared in the reference asset currency.

> Bring Ether to the protocol and start defining the asset allocation of the synthetic tracker

## What is sTrack?

STrack is the symbol for the synthetic trackers created by protocol. Each tracker is unique as it's customized to the investor trading strategy. Therefore sTrack is a non-tradable assets that can't be transferred or traded outside uTradeFi. Each synthetic tracker can be redeemed in their ETH equivalent value. There are no limitation for the monetization of the synthetic trackers and is allowed 24/7.  

## How do I make money?

Each investor need to bring initially some trading capital to the protocol. A synthetic tracker is then automatically minted for the specific wallet of the investor. Each investor will then amend the composition of the synthetic tracker by deploying these ETH to other assets which will hopefully outperform ETH (e.g. convert ETH to BTC). In the case the value of the tracker expressed in ETH is above the amount of trading capital originally transferred, a gain was generated and the investor is in a position to capitalize that gain by redeeming the tracker to unlock it's trading capital and corresponding gains.

## Can i sell my STrack to someone else?

No, synthetic trackers are locked in the protocol. However they can be liquidated at any time by converting the underlying assets into their ETH equivalent price and the initial investment capital freed up accordingly.

## How much does it costs?

uTradeFi pricing is fairly simple:
* a flat fee of 10bp for each transaction is paid (for buy/sell, shorts and all type of advanced trade). Each time a transaction is executed that flat fee is paid.
* a performance fee is taken if the synthetic tracker generates a positive gain, ie outperform the reference asset when the synthetic tracker is liquidated
