## Abstract

>uTradeFi is a decentralized protocol allowing investors to create customized **synthetic trackers** or **sTrack** across multiple asset classes. It's based on a peer-to-contract trading model where synthetic trackers are minted and burned accordingly to the investors trading activity. Investors define their trading rules by setting up **smart trading logics** that are executed automatically according to the instructions. Investors assume their individual market risks and are immune from the performance of other investors. The net performance of the system (e.g. everybody makes money) is guaranteed by the **pool performance underwriters** which are responsible for the overall performance of the investment pool to ensure that the system works when the pool grows as a result of successful investment strategies.
