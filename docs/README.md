# Introduction

Welcome to the official documentation website of uTradeFi!

You can find here all you need to know regarding uTradeFi and its amazing protocol.

>uTradeFi is a new generation of financial platforms giving the power to its innovative user base to create and customize unique financial products called **synthetic trackers**. uTradeFi allows to create what is known in the banking world as "Total Return Swaps" (TRS) to track the performance of baskets of assets. TRS are usually reserved to sophisticated investment bank clients via Prime Brokerage services. uTradeFi allows the creation of personalized TRS by the users themselves and even allows the composition of the TRS to change over time by setting up trading rules that can be even executed automatically by trading bots.

!>utradeFi provides advanced Prime Brokerage services to the users of the platform via a simple and intuitive interface. uTradeFi brings to power of investing back to the clients.

>uTradeFi is the solution for any financial player (e.g. banks, Fintechs) to offer to its innovative client base an easy access to a large investment universe via customized Total Return Swaps. Stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, cryptos can be tracked and part of the underlying basket the TRS is tracking. The platform provider need to hedge the overall exposure of the pool as it plays the role of the counterparty of the overall pool (this is similar to any TRS the bank might offer, i.e. the need to hedge to ensure it generates the performance of the overall pool). Customers pay a fee for each change in the composition of the syntetic trackers to the provider of the platform.

>uTradeFi relies on innovative technologies (blockchain) to give the users to freedom and power to create their own synthetic trackers. Smart contracts are managing the amount of collateral to ensure that at any time all gains and losses are cleared amongst the users of the system. Smart contracts are recording the composition of the synthetic trackers securely on the blockchain. Trading is done on a peer-to-contract model, frictionless, without any centralized or decentralized exchanges.

## Abstract

>uTradeFi is a decentralized protocol allowing investors to create customized **synthetic trackers** or **sTrack** across multiple asset classes. sTrack are customized Total Return Swaps (TRS) where the investors earn the performance (positive or negative) of the underlying basket of securities it's tracking. The protocol is based on a peer-to-contract trading model where synthetic trackers are minted and burned accordingly to the investors trading activity. Investors define their trading rules by setting up **smart trading logics** that are executed automatically according to the instructions. Investors assume their individual market risks and are immune from the performance of other investors. The net performance of the system (e.g. everybody makes money) is guaranteed by the **pool performance underwriters** (i.e. the provider of the platform) which are responsible for the overall performance of the investment pool to ensure that the system works when the pool grows as a result of successful investment strategies.
