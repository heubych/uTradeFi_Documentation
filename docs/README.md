## Abstract

>uTradeFi is a decentralized synthetic trading protocol allowing investors to create synthetic trackers across multiple asset classes frictionless. It's based on a peer-to-contract trading model where synthetic trackers are minted and burned accordingly to the investors trading activity. Investors define their trading rules by setting up smart bots that execute buy and sell orders according to their preferences. Investors have to pledge collateral to collateralized the potential trading losses that might occur in case of poor investment decisions. The overall performance of the investment pool is supported by Collateralized Debt Pool issuers that absorb the overall performance of the investment pool.
