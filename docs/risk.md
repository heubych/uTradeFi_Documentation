# Risk Overview

## Is it risky to use uTradeFi?

Yes. The sections below contain some of the key risks that investors might face while investing in uTradeFi. Most of these risks are common with other Defi protocols. Some are specific to uTradeFi (e.g. Investment risk).

## Investment risk

The protocol empowers investors to make money based on smart trading rules. But at the same time it creates a risk of loss for the investors when poor investment are made.

Investors are exposed to the market risk of their synthetic tracker as a result of their investment strategy. If bad investment decisions are taken, investors might occur a loss and will lose some ot the trading capital they have locked in the Protocol. In case of a loss, an investor will be able to repatriate only a part of its investment capital to its wallet.

Funding providers are exposed to the overall investment risk of the pool (e.g. more long than short)

!> Funding providers are exposed to the overall pool performance. When the overall pool grows due to the increase of the prices of the synthetic assets, funding providers will suffer a loss.


## Smart contract risk

The logics are implemented as smart contract on the blockchain. Smart contract risks are risks that occurs from bugs in the smart contracts. To mitigate these risks, various actions were performed:
* extensive testing of the protocol and its smart contracts
* independent review of the smart contracts by an audit firm
* publish the code of the smart contracts on github
* testing of the protocol on various testnets

!> Smart contracts are exposed to bugs (like any software)

## Regulatory risk

Regulatory risk is inherent to the supervisory  role of regulators. If investors were to ban such protocols, the synthetic trackers would be converted back to ETH and the collateral transferred back to the investors wallets. Therefore there's no real risk as the funds would be transferred immediately.

## Lack of pool Issuers

Lack would result in no capacity for trading. Not risky.
