# Risk Overview

## Is it risky to use uTradeFi?

The sections below contain some of the key risks that investors might face while investing in uTradeFi. Most of these risks are common with other Defi protocols. Some are specific to uTradeFi (e.g. Investment risk). Please read carefully and make sure you understand those before investing.

## Investment risk for the investors

The protocol empowers investors to make money based on smart trading rules. But at the same time it creates a risk of losses when poor investment decisions are made.

Investors are exposed to the market risk of their synthetic tracker as a result of their investment strategy. If bad investment decisions are made, investors might occur severe losses and will lose some of the investment capital they have locked in the protocol. In case of losses, investors will be able to repatriate only a part of their investment capital to their respective wallets.

!> Investors can lose money with bad investments decisions. In the worst scenario, investors might lose their entire investment capital.

## Market risk for the CDP Issuers

Funding providers are exposed to the overall investment risk of the pool

!> Funding providers are exposed to the overall pool performance. When the overall pool grows due to the increase of the prices of the synthetic assets, funding providers will suffer a loss.

## Smart contract risk

The logics defining uTradeFi are implemented as smart contract on the blockchain. Smart contract risks are risks that are the consequence of unknown bugs in the smart contracts. To mitigate these risks, various actions will be performed:
* extensive testing of the protocol and its smart contracts
* independent review of the smart contracts by an audit firm
* publish the code of the smart contracts on github
* testing of the protocol on various testnets

!> Smart contracts are exposed to bugs (like any software)

## Regulatory risk

Regulatory risk is the risk that a change in regulations or laws will materially impact uTradeFi. Regulators might ban such Defi protocols in the coming years.

If regulators were to ban such protocols, the synthetic trackers would be simply converted back to ETH and the investment capital transferred back to the investors wallets (adjusted by the gain and losses of the investment strategies obviously). Therefore there's no real risk as the funds would be transferred immediately back the investors.

## Lack of pool CDP Issuers

Lack of available funding would result in no capacity for trading. If at any point in time a lack of funding providers is detected.... what would we do???
