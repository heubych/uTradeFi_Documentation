# Risk Overview

## Is it risky to use uTradeFi

The sections below contain some of the key risks that investors might face will investing in uTradeFi. These risks are shared amongst other Defi protocols and not all specific to uTradeFi.

## Investment risk: specific to uTradeFi

The protocol empowers investors to make money based on smart trading rules. But at the same time it also creates a risk of loss for the investors.

Investors are exposed to the market risk of their synthetic tracker as a result of their investment strategy. If bad investment decisions are taken, investors might occur a loss and will lose some ot the trading capital they have locked in the Protocol. In case of a loss, an investor will be able to repatriate only a part of its invesmtent capital to its wallet.

!> Investors can lose money with bad investments decisions. However they can also benefit from it!

Funding providers are exposed to the overall market risk of the pool (e.g. more long than short)

!> Funding providers are exposed to the overall pool performance. When the overal pool grows due to the increase of the prices of the synthetic assets, funding providers will suffer a loss.


## Smart contract risk

The logics are implemented as smart contract on the blockchain. Smart contract risks are risks that occurs from bugs in the smart contracts. To mitigate these risks, various actions were performed:
* extensive testing of the protocol and its smart contracts
* independent review of the smart contracts by an audit firm
* publish the code of the smart contracts on github
* testing of the protocol on various testnets

!> Smart contracts are exposed to bugs

## Regulatory risk

Regulatory risk is inherent to the supervisionary role of regulators. If investors were to ban such protcols, the synthetic trackers would be converted back to ETH and the collateral transfered back to the investors wallets. Therefore there's no real risk as the funds would be transfered immediately.

## Lack of pool Issuers

Lack would result in no capacity for trading. Not risky.
